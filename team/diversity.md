Diversity

Diversity is incredibly important to WhileTrue. We value new ideas and perspectives stemming from different experiences. Our customer base consists of large and small companies, so having a diverse set of team members is essential to us succeeding as a team.

Team Background and Strengths
---

Our team comes from a wide range of backgrounds. We have people from multiple continents who speak many languages combined.

Rachel, from Singapore, brings a global perspective. She is experienced in the tech industry, having had internships at multiple start-ups and also plays rugby for her university, which has allowed her to develop excellent leadership and communication skills.

Steven also has a very diverse background, attending high school in Lebanon. He identifies as non-binary which helps understand the perspectives of the LGBTQ+ community. He also has industry experience, having worked at IBM for a year and then at an SAP firm for 4 months.

Cullen has experience in both software engineering and data analysis, having held software engineering and data analyst internships at Amazon and State Street. He is from Boston and provides insight into the US market.

Shuaitian also contributes to the team’s global background, having grown up in China before moving to the US for high school. He also helps the team with his strong backend skills.

Finally, Rishab, the team’s leader, rounds out the team’s global background by providing insight into Canada, having grown up in Canada. He brings the most software engineering experience to the team, having interned at a series A startup, being an early employee at a YC startup as well as having interned at Facebook and Google.


## Weaknesses

Regardless of our team’s diverse background, we still lack in certain areas that can negatively affect our team if not addressed. None of the members have any experience in marketing or working in regulated industries such as financial services, which is a considerable shortcoming considering this year’s theme of marketing science in regulated industries. Moreover, none of the team members have launched their own startups before, which gives us less experience in doing business side of things effectively or even building a MVP in the small amount of time we have.

### Subject Matter Experts

To address our shortcomings, we will enlist the help of subject matter experts. For our shortcomings in understanding the financial regulatory environment and market science expertise, we will use our industry partners from RBC. To address our inexperience in building a startup, we will enlist the instructors and TAs of the class. Further, as we are currently planning on using ML in our project, we will try to enlist some help from experienced practitioners such as graduate students or Ali, the ML lead from RBC.

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we do not have people who represent a few key  demographics. We are all in our 20’s and so there is no representation of older generations within the team. Therefore, we are unfamiliar with the needs and struggles of older generations. None of the team members are disabled either, so it would be harder for us to build with accessibility in mind. Finally, our team’s racial makeup does not capture a wide range of ethic groups. Namely, we do not have any people of Hispanic or African American descent on the team.

### How this can impact us

A potential impact of this is that having team members of diverse backgrounds would give us a better perspective about how to cater to a wider customer base. People with diverse backgrounds also contribute to a wider range of ideas. For example, the team consists of computer science students. We acknowledge that we are more problem solvers than creatives, thus making the ideation process difficult.

People with backgrounds that differ from our own can help us in the marketing science industry because they can help us come up with new ideas and build a product with the interests of a wider variety of people in mind.
