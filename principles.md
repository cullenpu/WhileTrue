# Team Principles
---

### Communication
- Team members will communicate using a private Slack channel: `while-true`.
- This channel will be used to ask/answer questions and schedule meetings.
- Each member of the team is expected to stay updated with the Slack channel. This means checking, and if needed, replying to messages at least once a day Monday - Friday.
- Meetings will be held regularly, around 1-2 times a week, to discuss team decisions, deliver updates, and keep team members on the same page
- Members of the team are expected to show up to meetings; if someone can’t make it, they should inform the rest of the team as soon as possible and catch up when they can.

### Work
- Members are expected to own their work. If issues arise after changes they made, they should fix those issues
- Work will be evenly delegated in our meetings in accordance to each team member’s strengths and their desire to learn.
- The team understands that timelines are often inaccurate, personal issues arise, and that setbacks happen and thus will give "softer" deadlines to allow for high quality work.

### Leadership Election

The team decided to elect Rishab Luthra as the current leader. Rishab has the most professional engineering experience in the group and also has a lighter course load this term so he can focus on ensuring the team and the project remain on track.
